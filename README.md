# Task1_Network_Visualization

In this repository I uploaded the following documents:
- data.json_maker.py <br />
This is the code to have the provided data in .json format. This was necessary for the 2D force network graph I developed in JavaScript. This one can be visualised in the following Web Application: [Andres_Web_Application](https://andresagdt515.github.io/Task2_Web_Development/)

- 3Dgraph.ipynb <br />
This is the code to visualise the 3D network graph I developed in Python. To do it I used a library called Jgraph, which gave me problems when running it in a plain python script and because of that I ended up coding it in a Jupyter Nottebook sheet.


## Usage

- data.json_maker.py <br />


- 3Dgraph.ipynb <br />


```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
